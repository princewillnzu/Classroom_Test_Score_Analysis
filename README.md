# Classroom Test Score Analysis

This project examines the academic performance of students based on demographic and socio-economic factors. Using **Microsoft Excel**, I analyzed test scores in **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing** to identify patterns and insights. The analysis was supported with Excel **sliders**, **graphs**, and various data visualization tools.

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored
- **Which ethnic group performed best overall?**  
  Average scores were compared across ethnic groups to highlight performance differences.

- **How does parental education level affect student scores?**  
  The project evaluates whether higher parental education correlates with improved academic performance.

- **What impact does lunch type have on performance?**  
  Students receiving standard lunch were compared with those on free/reduced lunch to assess potential score gaps.

- **How effective is the test preparation course?**  
  Score averages of students who completed the course were compared to those who did not.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables  
  - Interactive Sliders
